### *Overview*

The NgJAXComponents workspace is an enterprise-grade development environment engineered to 
streamline the creation, testing and deployment of shared UI components and libraries across 
the JAX CSSC ecosystem. Built on Angular's architecture, this workspace 
leverages modern build tools and development practices to optimize the component 
development lifecycle. 

The platform implements a monorepo structure using the Nx build system. By centralizing 
component development, the workspace facilitates code reuse, reduces duplication, and 
ensures architectural consistency across JAX CSSC applications. 

Maintained by the JAX CSSC UX/UI team, the workspace undergoes continuous updates to leverage 
the latest stable versions of core technologies, including Angular, TypeScript, RxJS, and 
associated testing frameworks. This commitment to technological currency ensures that 
shared components benefit from the latest performance improvements, security patches, 
and feature enhancements while maintaining backward compatibility.

# Under Progress


✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨


## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve ng-jax-components`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!


## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
